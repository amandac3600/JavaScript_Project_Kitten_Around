# Welcome to Kitten' Around!

Play here!: (link to be inserted later)

Kittin' Around is a 2D web-based platform game where you will be playing as a hungry cat, Bobo.  In order to feed Bobo, you have to navigate her to the fish at the end of the pond. There will be platforms for Bobo to jump on and around, as well as enemy mice that Bobo can kill by jumping on them.  There will also be catnip placed around the map that will grant Bobo temporary invulnerability to the enemy mice.  The game ends when Bobo gets her fish or when she touches a mouse.

<!-- # Instructions

Your goal is to get Bobo to the finish line at the end of the map, which will be designated by a fish.  
Bobo hates water, so you must make sure to avoid falling into the pond on the way.  On the path, there will be enemy mice for Bobo to avoid; but if Bobo eats some catnip, she will become invulnerable to mice.

Using the left and right arrow keys to move and the space bar to jump, get the hungry Bobo to the fish as fast as possible! -->
