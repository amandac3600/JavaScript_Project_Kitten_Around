# Welcome to Kitten' Around!

Play here!: https://amandac3600.github.io/Kitten_Around/

Kittin' Around is a 2D web-based platform game where you will be playing as a hungry cat, Bobo.  In order to feed Bobo, you have to navigate her to the fish at the end of the pond. There will be platforms for Bobo to jump on and around, as well as enemy mice for Bobo to avoid.  The game ends when Bobo gets her fish or when she touches water or a mouse.

# Instructions

Your goal is to get Bobo to the finish at the end of the map, which will be designated by a fish.  
Bobo hates water, so you must make sure to avoid falling into the pond on the way.  On the path, there will be enemy mice for Bobo to avoid.

Using the left and right arrow keys (or A and D) to move and the up arrow key (or W) to jump, get the hungry Bobo to the fish as fast as possible!
